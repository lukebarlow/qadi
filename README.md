Qadi allows you to keep track of lists of features for convenient manual QA
testing. It was created to help with work on WebAudio API related projects. It
is hard to write an automated test which listens to a sound and verifies that
it sounds right, so manual testing was the best way. 

To start up the server and see what it does, use

```
npm install # get all the relevant modules
node server.js
```

and then hit localhost:8089 in your browser
